## Add a Favicon

A **favicon** is the small image associated with a particular website. Most browsers display these as a visual reminder of the website in the address bar or in tabs. By default, the favicon for Course-in-a-Box courses is the box emoji pictured below. 

![box emoji]({{site.baseurl}}/img/favicon.ico)

#### Creating a Favicon

Head to [favicon.io](https://favicon.io/), a free and extensive resource that offers tools to quickly generate the correct files using an image, text, or emoji.

Once you've generated the favicon you'd like, the website will download a .ZIP folder called `favicon_io` that contains 6 different images. For Course-in-a-Box purposes, you'll only need the one titled `favicon.ico`

#### Uploading a Favicon

As long as your file is named `favicon.ico`, you don't need to make any code changes for this one. Head to the `img` folder,  click *Add File* > *Upload Files* (top right above the list of files), and use the upload tool to add your image. Once your file has uploaded, commit your changes and wait a few minutes to see the updated favicon appear.

You can update the favicon anytime by following this same process. Uploading a file with the same name will overwrite the previous version so you don't need to worry about deleting old versions.
